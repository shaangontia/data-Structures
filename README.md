# data-Structures
Sample programs for different data structures

This repo is meant for educational purpose only. I have tried coding for some basic data structures.
I will be updating the repo as much as I can but due to my less availability and my project works, updation could be less frequent.

If you feel anything can be changed or should be done in a better way then please put a comment. I will address it on my first availability.

Happy Coding...
